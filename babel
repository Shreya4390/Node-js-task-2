1. Babel is a JavaScript compiler. It's a popular tool that helps you use the newest features of the JavaScript programming language.
Babel is a tool that is used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backward compatible version of JavaScript 
  so that older browsers and environment will be able to understand your code.

For example, Node can't use ES6 import and export statements and some other cool features of ES6 syntax without the help of a compiler like Babel.
